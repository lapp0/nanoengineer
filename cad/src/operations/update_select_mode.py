update_select_mode.py - change currentCommand or assy.selwhat or selection
to make them consistent

@author: Bruce
@version: $Id$
@copyright: 2004-2008 Nanorex, Inc.  See LICENSE file for details.

Note: this can still have an effect, but ought to be generalized
and refactored. It is accessed as a method on the main window,
but is in its own file since it probably doesn't belong there
after refactoring and since that module is too long.

History:

bruce 050124 wrote this [as a method of the model tree];
should generalize and refile;
should be used for more or for all events

bruce 060403 revised this but didn't update docstring [of method in modeltree];
now it can change from *Chunk modes to Build, only, I think

bruce 081216 moved this out of class ModelTree (where it made no sense)
into its own file, to be called via a same-named method on MWsemantics

    Warning: this docstring is partly obsolete.

    This should be called at the end of event handlers which might have
    changed the current internal selection mode (atoms vs chunks),
    to resolve disagreements between that and the visible selection mode
    iff it's one of the Select modes [or more generally, i assume as of 060403,
    if the current mode wants to be ditched if selwhat has to have certain values it dislikes].
       If the current mode is not one of Select Atoms or Select Chunks (or a subclass),
    this routine has no effect.
    (In particular, if selwhat changed but could be changed back to what it was,
    it does nothing to correct that [obs? see end of docstring], and indeed it doesn't know the old value of
    selwhat unless the current mode (being a selectMode) implies that.)
       [We should generalize this so that other modes could constrain the selection
    mode to just one of atoms vs chunks if they wanted to. However, the details of this
    need design, since for those modes we'd change the selection whereas for the
    select modes we change which mode we're in and don't change the selection. ###@@@]
       If possible, we leave the visible mode the same (even changing assy.selwhat
    to fit, if nothing is actually selected [that part was NIM until 050519]).
    But if forced to, by what is currently selected, then we change the visible
    selection mode to fit what is actually selected. (We always assert that selwhat
    permitted whatever was selected to be selected.)
