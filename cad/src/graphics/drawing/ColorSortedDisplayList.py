ColorSortedDisplayList.py - A set of primitives to be drawn as a unit,
under runtime-determined drawing styles

@copyright: 2004-2009 Nanorex, Inc.  See LICENSE file for details.

History:

This was originally written by Russ in ColorSorter.py.
See that file for its pre-090220 history.

bruce 090220 added reentrancy, split it into this file.

bruce 090312 generalizing API (and soon, functionality) to support
other kinds of non-shader drawing besides color-sorted DLs.

TODO:

Change ColorSorter into a normal class with distinct instances.
Give it a stack of instances rather than its current _suspend system.
Refactor some things between ColorSorter and ColorSortedDisplayList
(which needs renaming). [bruce 090220 comment]

    The ColorSorter's parent uses one of these to store color-sorted display
    list state.  It's passed in to ColorSorter.start() .

    CSDLs are now created with a TransformControl reference as an argument (and
    are internally listed in it while they exist). This TransformControl
    reference is constant (although the transform in the TransformControl is
    mutable).

    For convenience, the TransformControl argument can be left out if you don't
    want to use a TransformControl to move the CSDL. This has the same effect as
    giving a TransformControl whose transform remains as the identity matrix.

    @note: as of 090223, the transformControl can also be a Chunk.
