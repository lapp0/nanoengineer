    Fix tooltips and whatsthis text and objects (for all OSes, not just macs
    as this function once did).

    This function does two things:

    1. If the system is a Mac, this replaces all occurrences of 'Ctrl'
    with 'Cmd' in all the tooltip and whatsthis text for all QAction or
    QWidget objects that are children of parent.

    2. For all systems, it replaces certain whatsthis text patterns with
    hyperlinks, and [obsolete comment] adds MyWhatsThis objects to widgets
    with text modified that way (or that might contain hyperlinks) or that
    are QPopupMenus.

    This should be called after all widgets (and their whatsthis text)
    in the UI have been created. It's ok, but slow (up to 0.2 seconds per call
    or more), to call it more than once on the main window. If you call it again
    on something else, as of 060319 this would have caused bugs by clearing
    _objects_and_text_that_need_fixing_later, but that can be easily fixed when
    we need to support repeated calls on smaller widgets. (As of the next day,
    that global list was no longer used, and on 080509 the code to maintain it
    is being removed -- whether repeated calls would still cause any bugs ought
    to be reviewed. I notice that there *are* repeated calls -- the main call
    in ne1_ui/Ui_MainWindow.py is followed immediately by another one on a
    smaller widget. So it's probably ok.)

    Calling this on a single QAction works, but doesn't do enough to fix the
    text again for toolbuttons (and I think menuitems) made by Qt from that
    action (re bug 1421).

    See also refix_whatsthis_text_and_links, which can be called to restore
    tooltips and/or whatsthis text which Qt messed up for some reason, as
    happens when you set tooltips or menutext for Undo and Redo actions
    (bug 1421). (Note that it hardcodes the set of actions which need this.)
