        Call func() between calls of self._before_drawing_csdls(**kws)
        and self._after_drawing_csdls(). Return whatever func() returns
        (or raise whatever exception it raises, but call
         _after_drawing_csdls even when raising an exception).

        func should usually be something which calls before/after_drawing_model
        inside it, e.g. one of the standard functions for drawing the
        entire model (e.g. part.draw or graphicsMode.Draw),
        or self._call_func_that_draws_objects which draws a portion of
        the model between those methods.

        If whole_model is True (default):

        Sometimes act as above, but other times do the same drawing
        that func would have done, without actually calling it,
        by reusing cached DrawingSets whenever nothing changed
        to make them out of date.

        Either way, always call prefunc (if provided) before, and
        postfunc (if provided) after, calling or not calling func.
        Those calls participate in the effect of our exception-protection
        and drawing_phase behaviors, but they stay out of the whole_model-
        related optimizations (so they are called even if func is not).

        @warning: prefunc and postfunc are not called between
        _before_drawing_csdls and _after_drawing_csdls, so they
        should not use csdls for drawing. (If we need to revise this,
        we might want to pass a list of funcs rather than a single func,
        with each one optimized separately for sometimes not being
        called; or more likely, refactor this entirely to make each
        func and its redraw-vs-reuse conditions a GraphicsRule object.)

        @param bare_primitives: passed to _before_drawing_csdls.

        @param drawing_phase: if provided, drawing_phase must be '?'
            on entry; we'll set it as specified only during this call.
            If not provided, we don't check it or change it
            (typically, in that case, caller ought to do something
            to set it properly itself). The value of drawing_phase
            matters and needs to correspond to what's drawn by func,
            because it determines the "drawingset_cache" (see that
            term in the code for details).

        @param whole_model: whether func draws the whole model.
            Default True. Permits optimizations when the model appearance
            doesn't change since it was last drawn.
