ChunkDrawer.py -- class ChunkDrawer, for drawing a chunk
(using OpenGL or compatible primitives -- someday this may cover POV-Ray
as well, but it doesn't as of early 2009)

@author: Josh, Bruce, others
@version: $Id$

History:

Written over several years as part of chunk.py.

bruce 090123 split these methods out of class Chunk in chunk.py.
(For prior svn history, see chunk.py. I decided against using
svn copy, even though this code has lots of history in there,
since it's shortly going to get refactored much more within
this file, and things will be clearer if this split starts
a clear separation of old and new in the history,
especially since 3/4 of the old chunk.py is not this code.)

bruce 090211 added markers where code was recently duplicated between self.draw
and TransformedDisplayListsDrawer.draw (not yet used). This should be refactored
soon into a common superclass, but first we need to

bruce 090212 change mixin class into cooperating object ChunkDrawer

bruce 090213 rename and move this module into graphics.model_drawing.ChunkDrawer


TODO: refactor:

 * someday, use GraphicsRules, and make more than one instance per Chunk
   possible (supporting more than one view of a chunk, mixed display styles,
   and/or multiple cached display styles)

    #bruce 090211 renamed from Chunk_drawing_methods, revised from mixin
    # into cooperating class. The older mixin class in this file contained all
    # drawing-related methods for class Chunk which use
    # OpenGL drawing (or the same drawing primitives)
    # or which directly handle its OpenGL display lists.

    # Note: there are a few significant points of interaction between methods
    # and attrs in Chunk and ChunkDrawer. These can be found via their
    # interobject references: self._drawer in Chunk points to this object,
    # and self._chunk in this class points to its Chunk. That might be revised
    # if there can be more than one instance of this class per Chunk (though we
    # presume they all refer back to the chunk for its color and display
    # style settings).

    # Some of the methods/attrs that might want further refactoring include:


    # - haveradii, if it should be different for different displayed views
    # of one chunk, which seems likely; if we move it, we might move sel_radii
    # etc and findAtomUnderMouse too -- or maybe they belong in yet another
    # cooperating class??

    # - findAtomUnderMouse is either specific to a glpane or needs one
    # (and a viewing ray, etc) passed in, though it's not a display/drawing
    # method but a picking/selection method.

    # - _havelist_inval_counter in this class, and Chunk _memo_dict, are only
    # used together (by whole-Chunk display styles (displaymodes.py), via new
    # methods in class Chunk). Further refactoring is desirable.

    # - self.glname is non-obvious, since it's possible that a chunk
    # has the same one even if displayed in more than one place -- or not,
    # if we want to use that to distinguish which copy is being hit.

                    # Specifically: When the following code decides to remake

                    # If wantlist is true (usual case), remakes and draws are
                    # separated (in some cases by passing draw_now = False to
                    # various draw-like methods), so drawing can be done later,
                    # outside of local coords, since CSDL.transformControl would
                    # be redundant with them, and since it might be deferred
                    # even more (into a DrawingSet we merely maintain in this
                    # method, by calling glpane.draw_csdl).
                    #
                    # If wantlist is False, remakes won't happen and drawing
                    # will be done immediately, within GL state that reproduces
                    # the desired local coordinates (current now, set up above
