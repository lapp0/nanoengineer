TreeModel.py - tree of nodes and rules for its appearance and behavior,

History:

For earlier history, see ModelTree.py.

Bruce 081216 is doing some cleanup and refactoring, including splitting
ModelTree and TreeModel into separate objects with separate classes and
_api classes, and splitting some code into separate files.

TODO:

As of 081218 (just after fixing bug 2948),
there are unexplained bugs in gl_update after MT selection click
(it happens, but the changed selection status is not redrawn;
might be a bug in other code) and non-undoability of MT selection
click (could it be lack of calls to change the selection counter in assy?)
