Chunk_Dna_methods.py -- dna-related methods for class Chunk

@author: Bruce, Ninad
@version: $Id$
@copyright: 2007-2009 Nanorex, Inc.  See LICENSE file for details.

History:

Bruce 090115 split this out of class Chunk. (Not long or old enough
for svn copy to be worthwhile, so see chunk.py for older svn history.)

TODO: Refactoring:

Some of the methods in this class are never used except on
Dna-related subclasses of Chunk, and should be moved into those
subclasses. Unfortunately it's not trivial to figure out for which ones
that's guaranteed to be the case.

There are some large hunks of duplicated code in this file
(pylint can detect them).

See also the REVIEW comments below, as always.

    # Someday: inherit NodeWithAtomContents (Chunk's main superclass) to
    # mollify pylint? It does mollify it somewhat and seemed initially to be
    # ok... but Chunk (as all Nodes) is still an old-style class, so it has no
    # __mro__ attribute and follows different inheritance rules than new-style
    # classes. It turns out that the old rules mess up in this case, if we use
    # that superclass on more than one pre-mixin class split out of class
    # Chunk, e.g. Chunk_mmp_methods, since then whichever one comes first
    # pulls in NodeWithAtomContents methods ahead of the other mixin's
    # methods, which prevents the other mixin from overriding those methods.
    # (This is exactly the "diamond-shaped inheritance diagram" issue that the
    # new-style mro rules fix.)
    #
    # The upside of this is that we can't inherit Chunk's main superclass in
    # its special-method-mixin classes until we make Chunk a new-style class
    # (which has issues of its own, common to all Nodes, described elsewhere).
    # Hopefully, before that happens, we'll have refactored Chunk further to
    # use cooperating objects rather than mixin classes. [bruce 090123]
