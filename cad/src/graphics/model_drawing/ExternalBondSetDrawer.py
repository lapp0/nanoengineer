        ### DUPLICATED CODE WARNING:
        # the following is similar in many ways to ChunkDrawer.draw.
        # See related comment there.

        # KLUGE: we'll use disp and color below, even though they come
        # from whichever of our chunks gets drawn first (i.e. occurs first
        # in Model Tree order). [After changing how we get them, bruce 090227,
        # that remains true -- it's just also true, now, even when we're
        # highlighted, fixing some bugs, except in rare cases where we were
        # never drawn unhighlighted.] The reasons are:
        #
        # - avoids changing current behavior about which chunk disp and color
        #   gets used (changing that is desirable, but nontrivial to design
        #   the intent);
        #
        # - not easy to recode things to draw bonds with half-colors
        #   (though if disps differ, drawing it both ways would be easy).
        #
        # Note that we'd like to optim color changes, which is probably easy
        # in the DL case but not yet easy in the shader case, so nevermind that
        # for now. (Also disp changes, which would be easier.)
        #
        # We'd also like to use this method for highlighting; that's a separate
        # project which needs its own review; it might motivate us to revise
        # this, but probably not, since CSDL and DrawingSet draw methods
        # implement highlighting themselves, whether or not it's a solid color.

        # ChunkDrawer._draw_external_bonds, but only when its chunk
        # was culled. (It uses self._ebset.bounding_lozenge.)

        # For now, AFAIK, we draw with a single color and disp, so the following is
        # correct regardless of how they are determined (but the determination
        # ought to be stable to reduce undesirable color changes and DL remakes;
