ExternalBondSet.py - keep track of external bonds, to optimize redraw

History:

bruce 080702 created

bruce 090211 making compatible with TransformNode, though that is unfinished
and not yet actually used.

(Update: as of 090225 TransformNode is abandoned.
However, I'm leaving some comments that refer to TransformNode in place
(in still-active files), since they also help point out the code which any
other attempt to optimize rigid drags would need to modify. In those comments,
dt and st refer to dynamic transform and static transform, as used in
scratch/TransformNode.py.)

# plan:
#
# initial test implem: do all bond drawing through this object,
# but do it just as often as right now, in the same way.
#
# see chunk._draw_external_bonds

# for now, we just maintain them but do nothing else with them,
# as of 080702 noon PT. update 080707: a debug_pref draws with them,
# false by default since predicted to be a slowdown for now.
# Retesting this 090126, it seems to work. Put drawing code into
# ExternalBondSetDrawer, but not yet doing any caching there (CSDLs).
# When we do, not yet known how much inval/update code goes there vs. here.
