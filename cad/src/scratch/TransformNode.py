TransformNode.py -- mutable transform classes, shared by TransformNodes

NOT YET USED as of 090204... declared obsolete as of bruce 090225:

- much of the specific code is obsolete, since we abandoned the idea of a
  number-capped TransformControl object (no need to merge TCs when too many
  are used)

- the concept of a separated dynamic and static transform, and letting
  them be pointers to separate objects, potentially shared, is a good one,
  which will be used in some form if we ever optimize rigid drag of
  multiple chunks bridges by external bonds (as I hope we will),
  but there is no longer time to implement it in this form (new superclass
  for Chunk), before the next release, since it impacts too much else about
  a Chunk. If we implement that soon, it will be in some more klugy form
  which modifies Chunk to a lesser degree.

Therefore, this file (and TransformState which it uses) are now scratch files.
However, I'm leaving some comments that refer to TransformNode in place
(in still-active files), since they also help point out the code which any
other attempt to optimize rigid drags would need to modify. In those comments,
dt and st refer to dynamic transform and static transform, as used herein.

class TransformNode(Node3D): # review superclass and its name
    """
    A Node3D which can be efficiently moved (in position and orientation)
    by modifying a contained transform. Children and control points may store
    relative and/or absolute coordinates, but the relative ones are considered
    fundamental by most operations which modify the transform (so the absolute
    ones must be invalidated or recomputed, and modifying the transform moves
    the node). (But certain operations can explicitly cause data to flow the
    other way, i.e. modify the transform and relative coordinates in such a way
    that the absolute position and coordinates remain unchanged.)

    The transform is actually the composition of two "transform components":
    an optional outer "dynamic transform" (used for efficient dragging of sets
    of TransformNodes) and an inner "static transform" (often non-identity for
    long periods, so we needn't remake or transform all affected CSDLs after
    every drag operation).

    Each transform component can be shared with other nodes. That is, several
    nodes can refer to the same mutable transform, so that changes to it affect
    all of them.

    The way self's overall transform is represented by these component
    transforms can change (by replacing one of them with a copy, and/or merging
    the dynamic transform into the static transform), without changing the
    overall transform value. We optimize for the lack of absolute position
    change in such cases.
