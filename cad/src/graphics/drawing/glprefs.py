History:

080519 russ pulled the globals into a drawing_globals module and broke drawer.py
into 10 smaller chunks: glprefs.py setup_draw.py shape_vertices.py
ColorSorter.py CS_workers.py c_renderer.py CS_draw_primitives.py drawers.py
gl_lighting.py gl_buffers.py.

090303 bruce refactored this and related code, pulling in shader prefs.

class GLPrefs:
    """
    This has not yet been split into its abstract and concrete classes,
    but is best described by specifying both aspects:

    Abstract: instances contain cached values of preferences or other settings
    which affect overall appearance of a GLPane, or content of most or all of
    its Chunks' display lists. There are public attributes for the prefs values,
    and public methods for setting up debug_prefs and updating cached prefs
    values. The update method should be called near the beginning of paintGL
    in order that the other methods and attributes have up to date values.
    Chunks can extract a change indicator (by calling materialprefs_summary)
    which combines all prefs values in which any changes need to invalidate
    all Chunk display lists.

    Concrete: the prefs/settings values are derived from specific env.prefs
    keys and/or debug_prefs. Only one instance is needed, and any number of
    GLPanes (or other "graphics environments") can use it (in current code,
    all GLPane_minimals and nothing else uses it).

        Update attributes from current drawing-related prefs stored in prefs db
        cache. This should be called at the start of each complete redraw, or
        whenever the user changes these global prefs values (whichever is more
        convenient).

        It is ok to call this more than once at those times --
        this will be a slight slowdown but cause no other harm. (Current code
        does this because more than one glpane can share one GLPrefs object,
        and because of a kluge which requires GLPane itself to update it twice.)

        (Note: When this is called during redraw, its prefs db accesses (like
        any others) record those prefs as potentially affecting what should be
        drawn, so that subsequent changes to those prefs values cause an
        automatic gl_update.)

        Using these attributes in drawing code (rather than directly accessing
        prefs db cache) is desirable for efficiency, since direct access to
        prefs db cache is a bit slow.  (Our drawing code still does that in
        other places -- those might also benefit from this system, though this
