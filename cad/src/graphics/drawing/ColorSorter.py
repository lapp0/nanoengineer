ColorSorter.py - sort primitives and store them in a ColorSortedDisplayList

@author: Grantham, Russ
@version: $Id$
@copyright: 2004-2009 Nanorex, Inc.  See LICENSE file for details.

History:

This was originally written by Brad Grantham (as part of drawer.py)
as a GL optimization to minimize calls on apply_material,
by sorting primitives into display lists based on color.

Later, it was repurposed by Russ to support runtime-determined drawing styles
and to permit some primitives to be drawn using GLSL shaders.

For early details see drawer.py history. More recent details are here
(though some of them cover the time before drawer.py was split
and might be redundant with drawer.py history):

080210 russ Split the single display-list into two second-level lists (with and
without color) and a set of per-color sublists so selection and hover-highlight
can over-ride Chunk base colors.  ColorSortedDisplayList is now a class in the
parent's displist attr to keep track of all that stuff.

080311 piotr Added a "drawpolycone_multicolor" function for drawing polycone
tubes with per-vertex colors (necessary for DNA display style)

080313 russ Added triangle-strip icosa-sphere constructor, "getSphereTriStrips".

080420 piotr Solved highlighting and selection problems for multi-colored
objects (e.g. rainbow colored DNA structures).

080519 russ pulled the globals into a drawing_globals module and broke drawer.py
into 10 smaller chunks: glprefs.py setup_draw.py shape_vertices.py
ColorSorter.py CS_workers.py c_renderer.py CS_draw_primitives.py drawers.py
gl_lighting.py gl_buffers.py

081003 russ Added sphere shader-primitive support to CSDLs.

081126 russ Added CSDL shader hover-highlight support, including glname drawing.

090119 russ Added cylinder shader-primitive support.

090220 bruce split class ColorSortedDisplayList into its own file

REVIEW [bruce 090114; some of this now belongs in ColorSortedDisplayList.py]:

* there are a lot of calls of glGenLists(1) that would be VRAM memory leaks
if they didn't deallocate any prior display list being stored in the same attribute
as the new one. I *think* they are not leaks, since self._reset is called
before them, and it calls self.deallocate_displists, but it would be good
to confirm this by independent review, and perhaps to assert that all
re-allocated DL id attributes are zero (and zero them in deallocate_displists),
to make this very clear.

* see my comments dated 090114 about cleaning up .dl, .selected, .selectPick,
and activate (and related comments in CrystalShape.py and chunk.py).

TODO:

Change ColorSorter into a normal class with distinct instances.
Give it a stack of instances rather than its current _suspend system.
Maybe, refactor some more things between ColorSorter and ColorSortedDisplayList
(which also needs renaming). [bruce 090220/090224 comment]
