Chunk_mmp_methods.py -- Chunk mixin for methods related to mmp format
(reading or writing)

@author: Josh, Bruce
@version; $Id$
@copyright: 2004-2009 Nanorex, Inc.  See LICENSE file for details.

History:

Written over several years as part of chunk.py.

Bruce 090123 split these methods out of class Chunk in chunk.py.
(For prior svn history, see chunk.py -- this is too small
to be worth dragging along all that history via svn copy.)

TODO:

Someday, refactor into a separate chunk-mmp-handling object.

Also review whether atoms_in_mmp_file_order belongs here,
and/or should be renamed to not be mmp-specific.

Also review whether two private methods defined in Chunk_Dna_methods,
and used only here, belong here (they are _readmmp_info_chunk_setitem_Dna
and _writemmp_info_chunk_before_atoms_Dna, and are specific to
both dna code for chunk, and mmp code).

        Return a list of our atoms, in the same order as they would be written
        to an mmp file produced for the given mapping (none by default)
        (which is the same order in which they occurred in one,
         *if* they were just read from one, at least for this class's
         implem of this method).

        We know it's the same order as they'd be written, since self.writemmp()
        calls this method. (Subclasses are permitted to override this method
         in order to revise the order. This can help optimize mmp writing and
         reading. It does have effects in the code when the atoms are read,
         but these are usually unimportant.)

        We know it's the same order they were just read in (if they were just
        read), since it's the order of atom.key, which is assigned successive
        values (guaranteed to sort in order) as atoms are read from the file
        and created for use in this session.

                        or None if this is not being used for mmp writing.
                        This can affect the set of atoms (and in principle,
                        their order) due to conversions requested by the
                        mapping, e.g. PAM3 -> PAM5.

        @note: this method is also used for non-mmp (but file-format- related)
        uses, but is still here in the mmp-specific mixin class because it has
        an mmp-related argument and is overridden by the mmp code of a
        subclass of Chunk.
