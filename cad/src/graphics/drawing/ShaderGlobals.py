ShaderGlobals.py - "global state" about a kind of shader in a GL resource context

@author: Russ, Bruce
@version: $Id$
@copyright: 2008-2009 Nanorex, Inc.  See LICENSE file for details.

History:

Russ developed some of this code in other files, mainly setup_draw.py,
glprefs.py, and drawing_globals.py.

Bruce 090303 refactored it out of those files to create this class
and its subclasses. Motivations: permit all prefs changes during a session,
and general modularity and cleanup.
