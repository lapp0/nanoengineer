TransformedDisplayListsDrawer.py - abstract class for something that draws
using display lists which it caches under a local coordinate system.

Note: as of 090213-17 this contains common code which is used, though
the "transformed" aspects are still not implemented or not used,
and there is still a lot of potential common code in the subclasses
(mainly in the draw method) not yet in this superclass since highly
nontrivial to refactor.

This code relates to:
- frustum culling(?)
- caching of multiple display lists (e.g. one per display style)
- display lists drawn under a transform;
  modifying them as needed if transform changes
  (needed by vertex arrays in CSDLs, not by pure OpenGL display lists)
- usage/change tracking related to display list contents

TODO: unify similar code in three places: here, ChunkDrawer, ExtraChunkDisplayList. ###
