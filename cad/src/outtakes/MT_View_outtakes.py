        """
        For each node in nodes, repaint that node, if it was painted the last
        time we repainted self as a whole. (If it wasn't, it might not be an
        error, if it was due to that node being inside a closed group, or to
        a future optim for nodes not visible due to scrolling, or if we're being
        called on a new node before it got painted here the first time; so we
        print no warning unless debug flags are set.)

        Optimization for non-visible nodes (outside scrollarea viewport) is
        permitted, but not implemented as of 080507.

        @warning: this can only legally be called during a paintEvent on self.
                  Otherwise it doesn't paint (but causes no harm, I think)
                  and Qt prints errors to the console. THE INITIAL IMPLEM IN
                  THE CALLERS IGNORES THIS ISSUE AND THEREFORE DOESN'T YET WORK.
                  See code comments for likely fix.

        # See docstring comment about the caller implem not yet working.
        # The fix will probably be for the outer-class methods to queue up the
        # nodes to repaint incrementally, and do the necessary update calls
        # so that a paintEvent can occur, and set enough new flags to make it
        # incremental, so its main effect will just be to call this method.
        # The danger is that other update calls (not via our modelTreeGui's mt_update method)
        # are coming from Qt and need to be non-incremental. (Don't know, should find out.)
        # So an initial fix might just ignore the "incremental" issue
