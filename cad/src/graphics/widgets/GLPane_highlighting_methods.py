        Candidate is an object which drew at the mouse position during GL_SELECT drawing mode
        (using the given gl_select name), and which (1) has now noticed this, via its entry in self.glselect_dict
        (which was made when GL_SELECT mode was exited; as of 050609 this is in the same paintGL call as we're in now),
        and (2) has already drawn into the depth buffer during normal rendering (or an earlier rendering pass).
        (It doesn't matter whether it's already drawn into the color buffer when it calls this method.)
           We should read pixels from the depth buffer (after glFlush)
        to check whether it has just reached self.targetdepth at the appropriate point,
        which would mean candidate is the actual newly picked object.
           If so, record this fact and return True, else return False.
        We might quickly return False (checking nothing) if we already returned True in the same pass,
        or we might read pixels anyway for debugging or assertions.
           It's possible to read a depth even nearer than targetdepth, if the drawing passes round
        their coordinates differently (as the use of gluPickMatrix for GL_SELECT is likely to do),
        or if events between the initial targetdepth measurement and this redraw tell any model objects to move.
        Someday we should check for this.
