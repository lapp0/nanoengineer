    Abstract class. Subclasses must define method _compute_current_value,
    which computes the current value associated with some sort of key,
    e.g. a prefs key. They must also have "recomputation code"
    which calls self.get_value as described below.

    ### REVIEW whether this later guess is correct:
    It is *not* necessary for _compute_current_value to do
    "standard usage tracking" of the kind defined in changes.py.
    This class is not directly related to that facility.
    However, clients may want it to do that for their own purposes,
    to track usage into the context in which they're called.
    NOTE THAT WE CACHE VALUES and this will defeat that tracking
    unless client code calls self.invalidate whenever they might
    have changed. ###

    Client code will have an instance of this class for each recomputation
    it wants to track separately for the need to be redone.

    When the client wants to use the result of the computation and is
    worried it might not be current, it calls self.do_we_need_to_recompute(),
    which checks whether self.invalidate() has been called, and if not,
    whether all keys that were used (i.e. passed to self.get_value)
    last time it recomputed still have the same value (according to same_vals).

    If that's false, our client can safely use its cached result from
    the last time it recomputed.

    But if that's true, the client calls self.before_recompute(),
    then does the computation and records the result
    (independently of this object except for calls to self.get_value
     which the client does during its recomputation),
