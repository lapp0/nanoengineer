ModelTree.py -- owner and external interface to the NE1 model tree
(which is implemented as several objects by the modules in this
modelTree package)

@version: $Id$
@copyright: 2004-2008 Nanorex, Inc.  See LICENSE file for details.

History:

modelTree.py was originally written by some combination of
Huaicai, Josh, and Mark. Bruce (Jan 2005) reorganized its interface with
Node and Group and their subclasses (Utility.py and other modules)
and rewrote a lot of the model-tree code (mainly to fix bugs),
and split it into three modules:

- TreeView.py (display and update),

- TreeWidget.py (event handling, and some conventions suitable for
  all our tree widgets, if we define other ones), and

- modelTree.py (customized for showing "the NE1 model tree" per se).

After that, Will ported it to Qt4, and since the Q3 compatibility
classes were unsupported by PyQt4, rewrote much of it, in the process
replacing TreeView.py and TreeWidget.py by a new file, modelTreeGui.py,
and adding a standalone prototype file modelTreePrototype.py (functional
as a separate test program, but not used by NE1). The current organization
might therefore be:

- modelTreeGui.py (display and update, event handling, and some
  conventions suitable for all our tree widgets, if we define other ones), and

- modelTree.py (customized for showing "the NE1 model tree" per se).

Bruce later rewrote much of modelTreeGui.py, and has added lots
of context menu commands to modelTree.py at various times.

Bruce 081216 is doing some cleanup and refactoring, including splitting
ModelTree and TreeModel into separate objects with separate classes and
_api classes, and splitting some code into separate files.
